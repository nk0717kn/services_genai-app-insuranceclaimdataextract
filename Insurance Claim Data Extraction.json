The main damage seems to be to the oven and surrounding cabinets. She mentioned smoke damage in the kitchen and dining area too. She thinks the total damage might be around $7,500. Her contact is 555-0123. No injuries reported, thankfully.\"\n\nExtract the following:\n- Policy Number\n- Claimant Name\n- Date of Loss\n- Time of Loss\n- Type of Loss\n- Brief Description of Damage\n- Estimated Loss Amount\n- Injuries Reported\n\n"

I am actively working to make sure the information will be located or stated as \"Not Found\"\n\n\n**Refining Field Identification**\n\nI'm now focusing on the other data points. I'm constructing logic to identify the \"Date of Loss\" and \"Time of Loss.\" I'm anticipating potential date and time formats to make sure I capture all variations. I'm developing patterns for recognizing \"Type of Loss\" and summarizing damage.\n\n\n",
